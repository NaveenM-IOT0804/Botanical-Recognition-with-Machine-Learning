## Overview

Botanical Recognition with Machine Learning is a project dedicated to the automatic recognition of medicinal leaves. This is achieved through the use of image classification models trained on a dataset of medicinal plant leaves. The project employs state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision techniques to make accurate predictions.

## Features

- Image classification and recognition of medicinal leaves.
- Utilizes deep learning models to achieve high accuracy.
- User-friendly interface for easy use and integration.
- Provides information on the identified plant, including its medicinal properties.

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models is not included in this repository. You will need to source your own dataset, which should consist of labeled images of various medicinal plant leaves. The dataset should be organized into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/botanical-recognition.git


## Usage

To use the trained model for leaf recognition, run the provided script and follow the usage instructions in the documentation.

```
python code.py
```
